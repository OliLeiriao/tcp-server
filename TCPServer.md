## Python TCP Client/Server ##

The goal of this personal project was to create my own TCP client and server using sockets in Python. I was drawn to this project because it is fundamental to understand how endpoints communicate within a network at a low level and how we can leverage custom scripts with libraries like Python’s socket to test and build tools off of these data communication channels. 

Basically, its my own custom nmap tool.

Built with the help of the free tutorial from FreeCodeCamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/)

# Sockets

A socket is an internal endpoint for sending and receiving data.

It is analogous to a physical power outlet, which connects your house to a centralized power source. The difference being that a computer’s socket is bidirectional.

In Python, the socket module is a library which allows for implementations of and interactions with sockets to enable data transmission through the various networking protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.).
